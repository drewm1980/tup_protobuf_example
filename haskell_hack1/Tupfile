# This command cannot be run by tup, because it generates a tree symlinks.
# You can run it manually, and then optionally add the symlinks to your

# Once you have run the above script, the code generation command should work.
# hprotoc is tricked via symlinks to generate the files in the current directory.
# Unfortunately, we ~still have the problem that tup requires us to specify the outputs...

#   calling readdir on symlink_tree when it scrapes it.
